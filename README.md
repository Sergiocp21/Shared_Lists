# What is Shared List?

Shared List is an Android App where you could invite some friends and family members to your own list so everyone can see or modify it.

## Use cases
* Is time to modify your routine and your gymbro is not up to date? Just share your list and both of you will have the same routine even if you change it again!
* Has your family got a shopping list but you always forget it at home? With Shared List you can have the shopping list wherever you want and even modify it on the go so you dont lose track on the list.
  Imagine your family member has already gone out to shop and you noticed that something is missing on the list. Don't worry! You can modify it and your family member will see the changes on real time.
